# 🧭 The Odin Project — HashMap Assignment (JavaScript)

This project is am implementation of a HashMap in JavaScript, following the Data Structures section of The Odin Project. 
It demonstrates how hash maps work internally — using hashing, bucket arrays, collision handling, load factor control, and resizing.

## 🧠 Learning Goals
- Understand how a hash map (hash table) stores key-value pairs efficiently.
- Learn about hash functions, collisions, and load factors.
- Implement set, get, has, remove, and resize logic from scratch.
- Practice clean, object-oriented JavaScript ES6+ code structure.# topHashMap
